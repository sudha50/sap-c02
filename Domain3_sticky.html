A company is deploying a new API to AWS. The API uses Amazon API Gateway with a 
Regional API endpoint and an AWS Lambda function for hosting. The API retrieves data 
from an external vendor API, stores data in an Amazon DynamoDB global table, and 
retrieves data from the DynamoDB global table The API key for the vendor's API is stored in 
AWS Secrets Manager and is encrypted with a customer managed key in AWS Key 
Management Service (AWS KMS). The company has deployed its own API into a single 
AWS Region. 
 
A solutions architect needs to change the API components of the company’s API to ensure 
that the components can run across multiple Regions in an active-active configuration. 
 
Which combination of changes will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational 
overhead? (Choose three.)

A. Deploy the API to multiple Regions. Configure Amazon Route 53 with custom domain
B. Create a new KMS multi-Region customer managed key. Create a new KMS customer

A company has a critical application in which the data tier is deployed in a single AWS 
Region. The data tier uses an Amazon DynamoDB table and an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB 
cluster. The current Aurora MySQL engine version supports a global database. The 
application tier is already deployed in two Regions. 
 
Company policy states that critical applications must have application tier components and 
data tier components deployed across two Regions. The RTO and RPO must be no more 
than a few minutes each. A solutions architect must recommend a solution to make the data 
tier compliant with company policy.

A company has millions of objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. The objects are in the S3 
Standard storage class. All the S3 objects are accessed frequently. The number of users 
and applications that access the objects is increasing rapidly. The objects are encrypted with 
server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). 
 
A solutions architect reviews the company’s monthly AWS invoice and notices that AWS 
KMS costs are increasing because of the high number of requests from Amazon S3. The 
solutions architect needs to optimize costs with minimal changes to the application. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create a new S3 bucket that has server-side encryption with customer-provided keys

A company needs to optimize the cost of its application on AWS. The application uses AWS 
Lambda functions and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers that run 
on AWS Fargate. The application is write-heavy and stores data in an Amazon Aurora 
MySQL database. 
 
The load on the application is not consistent. The application experiences long periods of no 
usage, followed by sudden and significant increases and decreases in traffic. The database 
runs on a memory optimized DB instance that cannot handle the load. 
 
A solutions architect must design a solution that can scale to handle the changes in traffic. 
 
 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Add additional read replicas to the database. Purchase Instance Savings Plans and RDS
B. Migrate the database to an Aurora DB cluster that has multiple writer instances. Purchase

A company has an application that uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster for the 
application's database. The DB cluster contains one small primary instance and three larger

many short-lived connections to the database's replica instances to perform read-only 
operations. 
 
During periods of high traffic, the application becomes unreliable and the database reports 
that too many connections are being established. The frequency of high-traffic periods is 
unpredictable. 
 
Which solution will improve the reliability of the application?
