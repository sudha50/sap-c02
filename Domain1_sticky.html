A company runs its sales reporting application in an AWS Region in the United States. The
application uses an Amazon API Gateway Regional API and AWS Lambda functions to
generate on-demand reports from data in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. The
frontend of the application is hosted on Amazon S3 and is accessed by users through an
Amazon CloudFront distribution. The company is using Amazon Route 53 as the DNS
service for the domain. Route 53 is configured with a simple routing policy to route traffic to
the API Gateway API.

In the next 6 months, the company plans to expand operations to Europe. More than 90% of
the database traffic is read-only traffic. The company has already deployed an API Gateway
API and Lambda functions in the new Region.

A solutions architect must design a solution that minimizes latency for users who download
reports.

A company uses AWS Organizations for a multi-account setup in the AWS Cloud. The
company uses AWS Control Tower for governance and uses AWS Transit Gateway for VPC
connectivity across accounts.

In an AWS application account, the company‚Äôs application team has deployed a web
application that uses AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS. The company's database
administrators have a separate DBA account and use the account to centrally manage all
the databases across the organization. The database administrators use an Amazon EC2

the application account.

The application team has stored the database credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets
Manager in the application account. The application team is manually sharing the secrets
with the database administrators. The secrets are encrypted by the default AWS managed

A company owns a chain of travel agencies and is running an application in the AWS Cloud.
Company employees use the application to search for information about travel destinations.
Destination content is updated four times each year.

Two fixed Amazon EC2 instances serve the application. The company uses an Amazon

A retail company is operating its ecommerce application on AWS. The application runs on
Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company uses an
Amazon RDS DB instance as the database backend. Amazon CloudFront is configured with
one origin that points to the ALB. Static content is cached. Amazon Route 53 is used to host
all public zones.

After an update of the application, the ALB occasionally returns a 502 status code (Bad

The webpage returns successfully when a solutions architect reloads the webpage
immediately after the error occurs.

A software company has deployed an application that consumes a REST API by using
Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda functions, and an Amazon DynamoDB table. The
application is showing an increase in the number of errors during PUT requests. Most of the
PUT calls come from a small number of clients that are authenticated with specific API keys.

A solutions architect has identified that a large number of the PUT requests originate from
one client. The API is noncritical, and clients can tolerate retries of unsuccessful calls.
However, the errors are displayed to customers and are causing damage to the API‚Äôs
reputation.

What should the solutions architect recommend to improve the customer experience?

A. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff and irregular variation in the client
B. Implement API throttling through a usage plan at the API Gateway level. Ensure that the
C. Turn on API caching to enhance responsiveness for the production stage. Run 10-minute

A company is in the process of implementing AWS Organizations to constrain its developers
to use only Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB. The developers account
resides in a dedicated organizational unit (OU). The solutions architect has implemented the
following SCP on the developers account:



When this policy is deployed, IAM users in the developers account are still able to use AWS
services that are not listed in the policy.

What should the solutions architect do to eliminate the developers‚Äô ability to use services
outside the scope of this policy?

A. Create an explicit deny statement for each AWS service that should be constrained.
B. Remove the FullAWSAccess SCP from the developers account‚Äôs OU.
C. Modify the FullAWSAccess SCP to explicitly deny all services.
D. Add an explicit deny statement using a wildcard to the end of the SCP.</div><div class="row ans">üéØ <b>Correct Answer:</b> B</div><div class="row keys">üîë <b>Keywords:</b> dynamodb, organizations, ou, s3, scp</div><div class="row elim">‚õîÔ∏è <b>Elimination Logic (each option):</b></div><ul><li><b>A</b> ‚Äî Not aligned with the exact requirement (directionality/scale/HA/security) stated in the stem.</li><li><b>C</b> ‚Äî Not aligned with the exact requirement (directionality/scale/HA/security) stated in the stem.</li><li><b>D</b> ‚Äî Not aligned with the exact requirement (directionality/scale/HA/security) stated in the stem.</li></ul><div class="row analogy">üß† <b>Analogy:</b> Gateway endpoints are like private side doors into S3/DynamoDB, avoiding the public street (NAT/Internet).</div><div class="hr"></div></section><section id="q18" class="card"><div class="qblock"><b>Q18</b>
A company has 10 accounts that are part of an organization in AWS Organizations. AWS
Config is configured in each account. All accounts belong to either the Prod OU or the
NonProd OU.

The company has set up an Amazon EventBridge rule in each AWS account to notify an
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when an Amazon EC2 security
group inbound rule is created with 0.0.0.0/0 as the source. The company‚Äôs security team is
subscribed to the SNS topic.

For all accounts in the NonProd OU, the security team needs to remove the ability to create
a security group inbound rule that includes 0.0.0.0/0 as the source.



Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Modify the EventBridge rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function to remove the security
B. Add the vpc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports AWS Config managed rule to the NonProd

A solutions architect has developed a web application that uses an Amazon API Gateway
Regional endpoint and an AWS Lambda function. The consumers of the web application are
all close to the AWS Region where the application will be deployed. The Lambda function
only queries an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. The solutions architect has configured
the database to have three read replicas.

During testing, the application does not meet performance requirements. Under high load,
the application opens a large number of database connections. The solutions architect must
improve the application‚Äôs performance.

Which actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose
two.)

A. Use the cluster endpoint of the Aurora database.
B. Use RDS Proxy to set up a connection pool to the reader endpoint of the Aurora
C. Use the Lambda Provisioned Concurrency feature.

A finance company hosts a data lake in Amazon S3. The company receives financial data
records over SFTP each night from several third parties. The company runs its own SFTP
server on an Amazon EC2 instance in a public subnet of a VPC. After the files are uploaded,
they are moved to the data lake by a cron job that runs on the same instance. The SFTP
server is reachable on DNS sftp.example.com through the use of Amazon Route 53.



What should a solutions architect do to improve the reliability and scalability of the SFTP
solution?

A. Move the EC2 instance into an Auto Scaling group. Place the EC2 instance behind an
B. Migrate the SFTP server to AWS Transfer for SFTP. Update the DNS record
