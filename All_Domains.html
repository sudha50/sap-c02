A company runs its sales reporting application in an AWS Region in the United States. The 
application uses an Amazon API Gateway Regional API and AWS Lambda functions to 
generate on-demand reports from data in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. The 
frontend of the application is hosted on Amazon S3 and is accessed by users through an 
Amazon CloudFront distribution. The company is using Amazon Route 53 as the DNS 
service for the domain. Route 53 is configured with a simple routing policy to route traffic to 
the API Gateway API. 
 
In the next 6 months, the company plans to expand operations to Europe. More than 90% of 
the database traffic is read-only traffic. The company has already deployed an API Gateway 
API and Lambda functions in the new Region. 
 
A solutions architect must design a solution that minimizes latency for users who download 
reports.

A company uses AWS Organizations for a multi-account setup in the AWS Cloud. The 
company uses AWS Control Tower for governance and uses AWS Transit Gateway for VPC 
connectivity across accounts. 
 
In an AWS application account, the company‚Äôs application team has deployed a web 
application that uses AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS. The company's database 
administrators have a separate DBA account and use the account to centrally manage all 
the databases across the organization. The database administrators use an Amazon EC2

the application account. 
 
The application team has stored the database credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets 
Manager in the application account. The application team is manually sharing the secrets 
with the database administrators. The secrets are encrypted by the default AWS managed

A company runs a serverless application in a single AWS Region. The application accesses

A company owns a chain of travel agencies and is running an application in the AWS Cloud. 
Company employees use the application to search for information about travel destinations. 
Destination content is updated four times each year. 
 
Two fixed Amazon EC2 instances serve the application. The company uses an Amazon 
Route 53 public hosted zone with a multivalue record of travel.example.com that returns the 
Elastic IP addresses for the EC2 instances. The application uses Amazon DynamoDB as its 
primary data store. The company uses a self-hosted Redis instance as a caching solution. 
 
During content updates, the load on the EC2 instances and the caching solution increases

A company runs a highly available data collection application on Amazon EC2 in the eu-

The company persists the output of the record processing to an Amazon S3 bucket in eu-

The company wants to increase its global presence. A solutions architect must launch the 
data collection capabilities in the sa-east-1 and ap-northeast-1 Regions. The solutions

A retail company is operating its ecommerce application on AWS. The application runs on 
Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company uses an 
Amazon RDS DB instance as the database backend. Amazon CloudFront is configured with 
one origin that points to the ALB. Static content is cached. Amazon Route 53 is used to host 
all public zones. 
 
After an update of the application, the ALB occasionally returns a 502 status code (Bad

The webpage returns successfully when a solutions architect reloads the webpage

A company is migrating a document processing workload to AWS. The company has 
updated many applications to natively use the Amazon S3 API to store, retrieve, and modify 
documents that a processing server generates at a rate of approximately 5 documents every 
second. After the document processing is finished, customers can download the documents 
directly from Amazon S3. 
 
 
 
During the migration, the company discovered that it could not immediately update the 
processing server that generates many documents to support the S3 API. The server runs 
on Linux and requires fast local access to the files that the server generates and modifies. 
When the server finishes processing, the files must be available to the public for download
