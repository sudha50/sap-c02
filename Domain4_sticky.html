A video processing company has an application that downloads images from an Amazon S3 
bucket, processes the images, stores a transformed image in a second S3 bucket, and 
updates metadata about the image in an Amazon DynamoDB table. The application is 
written in Node.js and runs by using an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function is 
invoked when a new image is uploaded to Amazon S3. 
 
The application ran without incident for a while. However, the size of the images has grown 
significantly. The Lambda function is now failing frequently with timeout errors. The function 
timeout is set to its maximum value. A solutions architect needs to refactor the application’s 
 
 
architecture to prevent invocation failures. The company does not want to manage the 
underlying infrastructure.

A company has migrated Its forms-processing application to AWS. When users interact with 
the application, they upload scanned forms as files through a web application. A database 
stores user metadata and references to files that are stored in Amazon S3. The web 
application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. 
 
 
 
When forms are uploaded, the application sends notifications to a team through Amazon 
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). A team member then logs in and processes 
each form. The team member performs data validation on the form and extracts relevant 
data before entering the information into another system that uses an API. 
 
A solutions architect needs to automate the manual processing of the forms. The solution 
must provide accurate form extraction. minimize time to market, and minimize tong-term 
operational overhead. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Develop custom libraries to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the forms.

A company is planning to migrate an Amazon RDS for Oracle database to an RDS for 
PostgreSQL DB instance in another AWS account. A solutions architect needs to design a 
migration strategy that will require no downtime and that will minimize the amount of time

A large mobile gaming company has successfully migrated all of its on-premises 
infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. A solutions architect is reviewing the environment to ensure 
that it was built according to the design and that it is running in alignment with the Well-
Architected Framework. 
 
While reviewing previous monthly costs in Cost Explorer, the solutions architect notices that 
the creation and subsequent termination of several large instance types account for a high 
proportion of the costs. The solutions architect finds out that the company’s developers are 
launching new Amazon EC2 instances as part of their testing and that the developers are 
not using the appropriate instance types.

A company is migrating a document processing workload to AWS. The company has 
updated many applications to natively use the Amazon S3 API to store, retrieve, and modify 
documents that a processing server generates at a rate of approximately 5 documents every 
second. After the document processing is finished, customers can download the documents 
directly from Amazon S3. 
 
 
 
During the migration, the company discovered that it could not immediately update the 
processing server that generates many documents to support the S3 API. The server runs 
on Linux and requires fast local access to the files that the server generates and modifies.

A company is planning to migrate its on-premises transaction-processing application to 
AWS. The application runs inside Docker containers that are hosted on VMs in the 
company's data center. The Docker containers have shared storage where the application 
records transaction data. 
 
The transactions are time sensitive. The volume of transactions inside the application is 
unpredictable. The company must implement a low-latency storage solution that will 
automatically scale throughput to meet increased demand. The company cannot develop the 
application further and cannot continue to administer the Docker hosting environment. 
 
How should the company migrate the application to AWS to meet these requirements?

A. Migrate the containers that run the application to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
B. Migrate the containers that run the application to AWS Fargate for Amazon Elastic
C. Migrate the containers that run the application to AWS Fargate for Amazon Elastic

A company is migrating an application from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. 
During migration design meetings, the company expressed concerns about the availability 
and recovery options for its legacy Windows file server. The file server contains sensitive 
business-critical data that cannot be recreated in the event of data corruption or data loss. 
According to compliance requirements, the data must not travel across the public internet. 
The company wants to move to AWS managed services where possible. 
 
The company decides to store the data in an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file 
system. A solutions architect must design a solution that copies the data to another AWS 
Region for disaster recovery (DR) purposes. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create a destination Amazon S3 bucket in the DR Region. Establish connectivity between
B. Create an FSx for Windows File Server file system in the DR Region. Establish
C. Create an FSx for Windows File Server file system in the DR Region. Establish

A company is planning to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The company 
currently hosts the data center on Linux-based VMware VMs. A solutions architect must 
collect information about network dependencies between the VMs. The information must be 
 
 
in the form of a diagram that details host IP addresses, hostnames, and network connection 
information. 
 
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS Application Discovery Service. Select an AWS Migration Hub home AWS
B. Use the AWS Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector for server data collection.
C. Install the AWS Application Migration Service agent on the on-premises servers for data
D.
